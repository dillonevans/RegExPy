# RegExPy

 A regular expression evaluator written in Python as an exercise in learning the language
 as well as applying knowledge of theoretical computer science. The expression entered is 
 converted into a parse tree, and using Thompson's construction that parse tree is then converted to 
 an NFA. Finally, that NFA is converted to a DFA used for expression matching using subset construction.
 Currently, only the lexer and parser has been written
